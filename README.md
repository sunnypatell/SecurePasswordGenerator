## Introduction

In the digital age, strong and secure passwords are crucial for protecting your online identity. Secure Password Generator is a Java-based application that addresses this need.

## Implementation Approach

Secure Password Generator was developed with a focus on simplicity, security, and user-friendliness. Here's an overview of the implementation approach:

- **Java:** The application is built using Java, ensuring platform independence and reliability.

- **User Interface:** designed a user-friendly interface using Java Swing, providing an intuitive experience.

- **Secure Password Generation:** The software uses secure password generation algorithms to create strong and unique passwords.


## Project Structure

The project's structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code files.
- `resources/`: Includes any necessary resources, such as icons or configuration files.
- `SecurePasswordGenerator.jar`: The executable JAR file.
- - `SecurePasswordGenerator.exe`: The executable windows file.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Creating the JAR File

The JAR file, `SecurePasswordGenerator.jar`, was created using the following steps:

1. Compile the Java source code.
2. Create a manifest file specifying the main class.
3. Use the `jar` command to package the compiled classes and resources into a JAR file.

The JAR file is executable on any system with Java installed.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The core programming language.
- **Java Swing:** For creating the graphical user interface.
- **Encryption Algorithms:** To protect user data.
- **Launch4j:** Used to convert the JAR file into a Windows executable (.exe).

## Secure Password Algorithms

Secure Password Generator employs secure password generation algorithms that adhere to industry best practices. The generated passwords are complex, random, and resistant to common hacking attempts.
